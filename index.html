							<h2>About me</h2>
							
							<p><span class="image left" class="cooldudes"><img src="images/Me.jpg"  height="185"/></span>
							
							Hello, my name is Morgan Westerberg and I am a game programmer. For the majority of my life, I have been interested in games and wanted to 
							create them myself. This lead to me creating my first small game using GameMaker Studio at the age of 14 following a YouTube tutorial. However, since 
							I did not know how to code I quickly became uninterested and stopped making games. In 2018-2019 I made some unfinished games in Unity with the help of
							Udemy courses, and in 2019 I had my first programming course in school.</p>

							I studied Game programming at Blekinge Institute of Technology during 2020 - 2023 and a lot was learned during that time. C/C++ was the main 
							programming language and a total of 5 games were created as assignments for different courses. We got to learn about how computer memory works and ways 
							to optimise code. Since we never used any pre-existing game engines in our assignments, the game engine experience is only something that took place during 
							our free time. However, during my free time I would often sit and create my own engine either using SFML or DirectX 11, since that is how I learned the most.
							I am currently learning Unreal Engine 5, as I am using it for a project.
							<br /><br />
							I mainly excel as a programmer, but I have also been a member that creates most of the trailers for our games. Due to having quite good <b>problem solving skills</b>,
							I have never given up on a task that I have begun implementing. Whenever I get stuck, I look at the problem from several angles, dividing up what needs
							to be done and what causes the problem. I love working in groups/teams since working with others that share the same passion help fuel my work and will to provide
							something I am proud of. I am very open to help others in need and often divide up the problem they are having into smaller steps to better explain
							what needs to be done.<br /><br />
