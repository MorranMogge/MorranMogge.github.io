								This game was developed as an assignment for the course Large game development project with agile methods at 
								Blekinge Institute of Technology. This course took place over a period of 4 months, where 7 people got together
								in order to create a game. This group consisted of 5 programmers and 2 technical artists. We used the agile method
								scrum, and split the game features into multiple tasks. Every 2 weeks teachers checked up on us to see if things
								had gone according to plan.

								<div id="myDIV1">
									<h3>Wrapper of Physics library<br /></h3>
									The first large task I took upon myself was to implement a wrapper in order to simply the creation and use of physics hitboxes.
									Since the physics was really important to us, we decided to use an already existing library in order to have more time for other
									features. But to use the library for our game, a wrapper had to be created. We chose to use the React Physics 3D library.<br /><br />

									In order to tackle this problem I first had to understand the libray. Luckily, they had documentation which was informative and gave
									enough information. My vision was to have our game objects inside the game have a physcis component, which handled all the physics.
									The group also agreed with this idea, since this would mean that all that was needed was for the user to specify the size and shape
									of the hitbox and then everything was handled automatically.

								<p style="text-align:center"><button onclick="myFunction(2)">Debugging Tools</button></p>
								<div id="myDIV2">
									<h3>Debugging Tools<br /></h3>
									In combination with the physics wrapper, I wanted a way to visualise these hitboxes to more easily debug and decide on appropiate sizes.
									This was a daunting task, since I did not know where to begin. After looking through the documentation of React Physics 3D, I found that
									they had a debugger. I could not get this debugger to render hitboxes, and therefore decided to create my own. This debugger used information
									given by react's debugger, which was information about all the triangles in the scene. To render the triangles, I created a pipeline and a way
									to store the information about the triangles that worked for our pipeline. Every frame, the information regarding the triangles had to be updated. 
									This was to ensure the positions were correct every frame. When another collision box was added to the game, the debugger also had to update the 
									recreate the vertex buffer to fit the new triangles. After hours of debbuging I managed to get it to work, and it helped tromendously finding 
									correct sizes of hitboxes for the items.

									<i>Rendering of hitboxes using the debugging tool</i><br /><br />
									
									Another debugging tool I created was one able to render vectors. This was done mainly since the player had some issues regarding movement. Since
									the movement used vectors, and since vectors are quite hard to understand when looking at the data, I made a debugger to visualse it instead. This
									debugger simply draws a line between to points in space, where the pipeline also takes in colour values in the place that normals usually occupy, 
									allowing the coder so choose a different colour for every line.

								<h2>Game Concept Challenge 2023<br /></h2>
								<a class="image fit" width=650><img src="images/GCCWinner.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								During the development of the game, we were pushed by the teachers to enter a competition known as Game Concept Challenge, hosted
								by Creative Coast Festival and Gameport. After discussions within the group, we decided to join the competition since we thought that we had an interesting
								idea, and that we would want to continue developing the game. In the game concept challenge, games or game ideas are submitted, and 
								ones that stand out are elected as winners. Our game was one of the winners and won a price of ca $2500 towards the buissness.
